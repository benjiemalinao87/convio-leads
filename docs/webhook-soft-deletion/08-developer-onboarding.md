#### Code Reading Checklist

For each file, identify:

- [ ] **Purpose**: What does this file do?
- [ ] **Inputs**: What data does it receive?
- [ ] **Outputs**: What does it produce?
- [ ] **Dependencies**: What other files/services does it use?
- [ ] **Error Handling**: How are errors managed?

#### Practical Exercise: Trace a Request

Pick one scenario and trace it through the code:

**Scenario: User soft-deletes a webhook**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User clicks Delete] --> B[SoftDeleteDialog opens]
    B --> C[User selects soft delete + reason]
    C --> D[handleDeleteConfirm called]
    D --> E[DELETE /webhook/:id API call]
    E --> F[webhook.ts DELETE route handler]
    F --> G[Schedule queue job]
    G --> H[Update database]
    H --> I[Return success response]
    I --> J[UI updates]
```

**Your Task:** Find the exact code locations for steps D, F, G, and H.

### Day 2: Deep Dive

#### Morning: Database Deep Dive (2 hours)

1. **Set up database access** (if available)
   ```bash
   # Connect to development database
   cd webhook-api/webhook-api
   wrangler d1 execute convio-leads --command "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM webhook_configs;"
   ```

2. **Study the schema**
   ```sql
   -- Understand table relationships
   PRAGMA table_info(webhook_configs);
   PRAGMA table_info(webhook_deletion_events);
   PRAGMA table_info(webhook_scheduled_deletions);

   -- Explore sample data
   SELECT * FROM webhook_configs LIMIT 5;
   SELECT * FROM webhook_deletion_events LIMIT 5;
   ```

3. **Practice queries**
   ```sql
   -- Find soft-deleted webhooks
   SELECT webhook_id, name, deleted_at, deletion_reason
   FROM webhook_configs
   WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL;

   -- Get deletion history for a webhook
   SELECT event_type, event_timestamp, reason
   FROM webhook_deletion_events
   WHERE webhook_id = (SELECT id FROM webhook_configs WHERE webhook_id = 'some-webhook-id')
   ORDER BY event_timestamp;
   ```

#### Afternoon: API Deep Dive (2 hours)

1. **Study API endpoints**
   - Read [API Documentation](./04-api-documentation.md)
   - Understand request/response formats
   - Learn error codes and handling

2. **Test API calls** (if dev environment available)
   ```bash
   # List active webhooks
   curl -X GET "https://dev-api.homeprojectpartners.com/webhook"

   # List deleted webhooks
   curl -X GET "https://dev-api.homeprojectpartners.com/webhook/deleted"

   # Test soft delete (on test webhook)
   curl -X DELETE "https://dev-api.homeprojectpartners.com/webhook/test-webhook-123?reason=Learning" \
     -H "X-User-ID: intern-user"
   ```

3. **API Integration Practice**
   Write a simple script to interact with the API:
   ```javascript
   // api-test.js
   async function testSoftDeletion() {
     // Create test webhook
     // Soft delete it
     // Check it appears in deleted list
     // Restore it
     // Verify it's back in active list
   }
   ```

  }
}
```

## üîç Phase 3: Hands-on Exploration (Days 4-5)

### Day 4: Frontend Exploration

#### Morning: Component Analysis

1. **SoftDeleteDialog Component**
   ```typescript
   // Study this component - locate it in your IDE
   // src/components/webhooks/SoftDeleteDialog.tsx

   // Questions to explore:
   // - How does it handle soft vs force delete?
   // - Where is form validation logic?
   // - How are confirmation requirements implemented?
   // - What props does it receive from parent?
   ```

2. **Practice: Modify the Dialog**
   ```typescript
   // Try making these changes (on a branch):
   // 1. Add a new field for "urgency level"
   // 2. Change the confirmation text
   // 3. Add a warning message for force delete
   // 4. Test your changes
   ```

#### Afternoon: State Management

1. **Webhooks.tsx Integration**
   ```typescript
   // Understand how state flows:
   // - How is webhook data fetched?
   // - How do delete/restore operations update UI?
   // - Where is loading state managed?
   // - How are errors handled and displayed?
   ```

2. **Practice: Add a Feature**
   ```typescript
   // Try adding a "Delete Multiple" feature:
   // 1. Add checkboxes to webhook cards
   // 2. Add a "Delete Selected" button
   // 3. Implement bulk deletion logic
   // (Don't commit - this is just practice!)
   ```

### Day 5: Backend Exploration

#### Morning: Queue System

1. **Understanding the Queue Consumer**
   ```typescript
   // Study webhook-deletion.ts
   // - How are jobs processed?
   // - What happens if a job fails?
   // - How is retry logic implemented?
   // - Where are jobs scheduled from?
   ```

2. **Practice: Debug the Queue**
   ```bash
   # Run these commands to understand queue state:
   wrangler queues list

   # Check for pending jobs
   wrangler d1 execute convio-leads --command "
   SELECT job_id, status, execute_at, attempts
   FROM webhook_scheduled_deletions
   WHERE status = 'pending';"

   # Monitor queue processing
   wrangler logs --tail
   ```

#### Afternoon: API Enhancement

1. **Add a New Endpoint**
   ```typescript
   // Practice by adding this endpoint to webhook.ts:
   // GET /webhook/:id/deletion-history
   // Should return all deletion events for a webhook

   webhook.get('/:webhookId/deletion-history', async (c) => {
     // Your implementation here
     // 1. Validate webhook ID
     // 2. Get webhook internal ID
     // 3. Query deletion events
     // 4. Return formatted response
   });
   ```

2. **Test Your Implementation**
   ```bash
   # Deploy locally and test
   npm run dev

   # Test the new endpoint
   curl http://localhost:8787/webhook/test-webhook-123/deletion-history
   ```

### Self-Assessment Exercises

#### Exercise 1: Request Flow Tracing
Map out the complete flow for webhook restoration:
1. User clicks "Restore" button
2. ‚Üí Frontend component: ?
3. ‚Üí API endpoint: ?
4. ‚Üí Database operations: ?
5. ‚Üí Queue operations: ?
6. ‚Üí Response handling: ?

#### Exercise 2: Error Scenario Handling
What happens in these scenarios?
1. User tries to restore an expired webhook
2. Queue consumer fails to process a job 3 times
3. Database transaction fails during soft deletion
4. User tries to delete a webhook that doesn't exist

#### Exercise 3: Performance Analysis
Identify potential performance bottlenecks:
1. Database queries that could be slow
2. API endpoints that might timeout
3. Frontend operations that could cause lag
4. Queue processing limitations
